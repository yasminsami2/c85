                  Claim: <strong>Andrey</strong> Rublev abused the line judge in
                  English, dropping the f-bomb Following a sensational default
                  from the semi-final of the Dubai Tennis Championships, Andrey
                  Rublev has become a hot topic of discussion. The Andrey Rublev
                  ranking went to No.6 after the match too. After losing a point
                  against Alexander Bublik in the semi-final, his frustration
                  boiled over as he yelled at the line official. He believed his
                  opponent had hit the ball long but it was not ruled out

                    You have 20 seconds between the points and 90 seconds when
                    changing sides of the court. Unfortunately, many players
                    lose the crucial points because they hurry up. They finish
                    one point, take the ball, go to the baseline and quickly
                    start the new point. That is the easiest recipe to lose a
                    few important points in a row, decrease your quality of play
                    and affect your confidence. Before the decisive point, make
                    sure you use the whole time allowed. You should go through
                    your routine to prepare your body and mind for the incoming
                    challenge.

                    Preparation is the key to effective performance. If you face
                    some pressing situations on the court, it is required that
                    you have a plan. By knowing what to do and which skills to
                    use against your opponent, you significantly lower the
                    stress level because you wonâ€™t have to make a decision right
                    before the hit. Twenty seconds between the points is enough
                    to create a simple tactic that will give you an advantage
                    during the point.
